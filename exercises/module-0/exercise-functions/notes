Exercise - Functions

Functions are important building blocks in any language. 
They help ensure that your code follows the 

DRY PRINCIPLE 

and that you follow a design principle called 

Separation of Concerns. 

Your functions should "do one thing and do it well" (McIlroy). 
These exercises will help strengthen your function know-how.

+ Write a function that accepts two numbers as parameters, 
  and returns the sum. +

+ Write a function that accepts three numbers as parameters, 
  and returns the largest of those numbers. +

+ Write a function that accepts one number as a parameter, 
  and returns whether that number is even or odd. 
  (Return the string "even" or "odd") +

+ Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter. 
  If the length of the string is less that or equal to twenty characters long, 
  return the string concatenated with itself(string + string). 
  If the string is more than twenty characters long, 
  return the first half of the string.
