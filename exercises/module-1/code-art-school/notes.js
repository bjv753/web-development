// Styling code can be a tricky task, sometimes requiring some good ol' guess-and-check changes to the CSS. Fortunately, doing this with code is a lot less permanent than doing this with your artwork.

// Project Requirements
// Open the project web page in a new browser window. Your job is to change some styles right in your browser to make the content flow better, look less old-school and a lot more colorful.

// We'll leave it up to you to decide which colors to use, but there are a few things you'll need to make sure to change:

// Add some color to the headers and the nav bar
// Resize the photos to be a little bigger and more visible
// Make the font a little bigger and change the color so it's more easily read.
// Change the font style so it's not terrible
// WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT REFRESH OR NAVIGATE AWAY FROM THE PAGE.
// Since these changes are temporary, refreshing the page would undo all of your changes.

// Passing Criteria: Visual Inspection
// An instructor or TA will come around to check out your final product and make sure you have a solid grasp on editing code with the developer tools.

// This project passes off the following levels of the Skills Tree:

// Troubleshooting/Debugging, Level 1
