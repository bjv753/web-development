                  personalObject.disp();
                  // because the new PersonalDataClass() is spelled the same as the function PersonalDataClass() n is now assigned to name, a is now assigned to address, w is now assigned to work, and h is now assigned to home. 
                  // the value assigned to n will be outputted to the parameter value with the exact same index value. in n's case n is equal to index[0] in names case name is equal to index[0];

                  // and then, once the parameters of function PersonalDataClass(name, address, work, home) receive these new values, 
                  // these new values will be assigned to the propertie values the original parameters of the function PersonalDataClass(name, address, work, home) are also assigned to.

<!-- so, the class properties inside the object curly brackets on the next line down  
     he's having programming dreams ha ha

                        {
                            this.name = name;
                            this.address = address;
                            this.work = work;
                            this.home = home;
                            this.disp = disp;
                        }
    must be assigned (===) to either a variable, parameter, or function.

                    this.disp = disp; is = a class function property.

                    this.disp = disp; holds a reference place of the function disp()
                    because the spelling of disp === disp

                    since this.disp = disp; is a property of the 
                    Construtor function 
                    PersonalDataClass(name, address, work, home)
                    {
                        this.name = name;
                        this.address = address;
                        this.work = work;
                        this.home = home;
                        this.disp = disp;
                    }
                    now we can create a new function called 
                    function disp()
                    {

                    }
                    and now the 
                    function disp()
                    {

                    } 
                    has access to all of the properties
                    inside the Construtor Function 
                    PersonalDataClass(name, address, work, home) 
                    {
                        this.name = name;
                        this.address = address;
                        this.work = work;
                        this.home = home;
                    }
                    because this.disp = disp; is a property of
                    the Constructor Function 
                    PersonalDataClass(name, address, work, home)
                    {
                        this.name = name;
                        this.address = address;
                        this.work = work;
                        this.home = home;
                        this.disp = disp;
                    }

                    inside each object is an {enviornment}. the {environment} inside each object
                    has this.properties = properties which are called propterties & are fully 
                    aware of the {environment} in which they exist, inside the object === {}. 
                    
                    now, imagine the property this.name = name; has 5 main senses stricktly 
                    equal to your five senses. now, imagine each this.property = property
                    is actually a student learning inside^âˆž a class room. The this.properties = 
                    properties; which are now students, are aware of each student and can 
                    interact with each student. now imagine the environment inside each object
                    is actually a class room. notice the word class before class room and link 
                    the word class in the phrase class room to the word Class in the constructor 
                    function Personal Data Class.
